**Flow operations using RESTCONF**  
To use RESTCONF, a RESTful API client is needed.

The Frinx ODL Distribution comes with one preinstalled: the **YangUI**.

An alternative is to use the **Chrome Postman** extension: [https://www.getpostman.com][1]

Many OpenDaylight projects using RESTCONF have made examples of HTTP requests available as [Postman libraries][2]

**Examining OpenFlow devices using RESTCONF**  
The operational datastore containing the OpenFlow nodes is exposed at the URL below. ***Warning: Datastores contain a large amount of data and loading them into a web browser may cause a temporary lockup.***

    HTTP Method: GET  
    HTTP URL: <http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes>#  
    HTTP Headers: Content-type: application/xml Accept: application/xml
    

To see the flows on node openflow:1 only

    HTTP Method: GET  
    HTTP URL: [http://10.10.199.149:8181/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/openflow:1 ][3]  
    HTTP Headers: Content-type: application/xml Accept: application/xml
    

To program the openflow:1 switch, send an HTTP POST request to the controller. The payload and the URI are defined in the YANG model used.

    HTTP Method: POST  
    HTTP URL: [http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/openflow:1/table/0/flow/1 ][4]  
    HTTP Headers: Content-type: application/xml Accept: application/xml
    
    HTTP Content: <img class="aligncenter wp-image-2472 size-full" src="https://frinx.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/restconf-http.png" alt="restconf-http" width="787" height="695" />
    

We expect any switch which implements OpenFlow versions 1.0 and 1.3.2. to be programmable by the Frinx ODL Distribution. A list of such switches is maintained [here][3] Note that if you already have one of these devices, you may need to upgrade its firmware.

**Next steps**  
The OpenDaylight [user guide][4] describes more operations which are possible using the l2switch feature.
