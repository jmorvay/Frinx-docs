#### New Features, Improvements
* CLI plugin
    - Added clustering - tested with 3 node cluster
    - Added option for disabling reconciliation
    - Added caching of command outputs when root element is read
* Unified layer and unitopo-units
    - Implemented translation units for Junos 17.3 using NETCONF
    - Added connection status to unified node in OPER DS
    - Added clustering - tested with 3 node cluster
* UniConfig framework
    - Fixed removing of UniConfig node when CLI/NETCONF node is removed from CONF DS
    - Added clustering - tested with 3 node cluster
    - Dry-run node manager – A “dry run” only counterpart to UniConfig node manager that allows users and apps to verify configuration updates across network before pushing the actual configuration. Dry run produces a list of CLI commands to be executed per device for review. All additional validation implemented by the translation units is also triggered. Works only for CLI devices.

#### Known Issues
1. odl-netconf-clustered-topology:
    - Contains critical bugs and is not intended for production use, so odl-netconf-topology was modified by FRINX so that it can work in cluster. FRINX recommends using odl-netconf-topology in production environments.
2. restconf/operational/entity-owners:
    - entity-owners contains no data as entity ownership service was rewritten. Entity owners are assigned to the same node that hosts shard leaders.
3. CLI telnet connectivity with reverse telnet on Cisco devices is not supported in this release.
4. L2/3VPN service modules are supported on single node ODL.
5. Readers returning default data for non-existent instances.
    - When a specific query is issued for a child readers e.g. AreaReader in OSPF for XR, it will return default data back instead of a 404 response.
6.  Update in CLI translation units does not work properly - it invokes delete and create operations by default
