This document describes the latest changes, additions, known issues, and fixes for the Frinx ODL Distribution.<!--more-->

**Note that FRINX ODL distribution 3.1.3 requires Java 8**  
To install Java:  
Ubuntu: In a terminal type

    sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre

CentOS: In a terminal type

    sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk

#### New Features, Improvements
* CLI plugin
    - Fix IO issues causing multiple network connections to device after reconnect
    - Do not return default data for non existing nodes - When reading a non-existing interface via RESTCONF, ODL returned http code 200 with default data in payload, now it returns code 404, as expected
    - Removed “safe-command-execution” from mount request - mount request cannot contain parameter “safe-command-execution” anymore. Behaviour enabled by safe-command-execution is default behaviour now.
* Unified layer and unitopo-units
    - Translate layer caching added to improve mount speed for Unified mountpoints - Subsequent mounts of similar devices are now slightly faster and consume less memory as translate contexts are reused.
    - Do not return default data for non existing nodes - When reading a non-existing interface via RESTCONF, ODL returned http code 200 with default data in payload, now it returns code 404, as expected
    - Add commit-per-update mode for devices managed over netconf - Typically a single transaction in Unified mountpoint is mapped to a single netconf transaction on a device, but due to violations of NETCONF RFC some devices have to be treated in a special way, where 1 transaction in Unified is mapped to N transactions in NETCONF and each change is submitted with a dedicated commit.
* UniConfig framework
    - Configuration metadata (last commit fingerprint) in actual uniconfig node (OPER DS) - Operational data containing configuration fingerprint (timestamp of last configuration obtained from device). This feature can be used to check whether configuration has been updated on a device.
    - Optimized sync-from-network operation thanks to configuration metadata caching - If a device and its units expose last commit fingerprint information, uniconfig will store that information and use it to verify that configuration has been updated on a device, before issuing a full sync-from-network operation. This process speeds up sync-from-network significantly since it only has to issue a full sync-from-network on devices which configuration has really been updated.
    - Snapshot manager - New component in UniConfig to manage snapshots and enforce a limit on their number
    - Operation checked-commit - similar to commit operation but with addition that configuration metadata between device and UniConfig state are compared first. If they are different the checked-commit fails and UniConfig does not configure network elements.
    - Added “target-nodes” to input of RPCs - UniConfig RPCs take “target-nodes” containing list of nodes for which an operation should be executed.

#### Known Issues
1. odl-netconf-clustered-topology:
    - Contains critical bugs and is not intended for production use, so odl-netconf-topology was modified by FRINX so that it can work in cluster. FRINX recommends using odl-netconf-topology in production environments.
2. restconf/operational/entity-owners:
    - entity-owners contains no data as entity ownership service was rewritten. Entity owners are assigned to the same node that hosts shard leaders.
3. CLI telnet connectivity with reverse telnet on Cisco devices is not supported in this release.
4. L2/3VPN service modules are supported on single node ODL.
5. Readers returning default data for non-existent instances.
    - When a specific query is issued for a child readers e.g. AreaReader in OSPF for XR, it will return default data back instead of a 404 response.
6.  Update in CLI translation units does not work properly - it invokes delete and create operations by default

#### Opendaylight Carbon Release Notes
The Frinx controller 3.1.3 is based on OpenDaylight Carbon.
