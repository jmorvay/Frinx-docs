**Installation**

1\. If you have not already done so, [Download the FRINX ODL distribution][1] and [install it][2]  
2\. [Install Elasticsearch][3]

In the unpackaged folder, start elasticsearch with

    bin/elasticsearch
    

3\. [Install Kibana][4] - download the version appropriate to your system. For the Linuz-64 bit tar.gz download file, unpackage it with

    tar -xvf filename
    

In the unpackaged folder, start kibana with

    bin/kibana
    

4\. [Install logstash][5] - which we'll use for collecting and parsing log files. It can transform an unstructured log into something meaningful and searchable.

For the Linuz-64 bit tar.gz download file, unpackage it with

    tar -xvf filename
    

**Configuration**

The base configuration is to use log4j socket listener for Logstash and the log4j socket appender in ODL Frinx.

We must now configure socket listener for Logstash:

From your logstash folder (the folder created from unpackaging the download file at the start of this guide), move into the config folder:

    cd config
    

Create a blank file named logstash.conf

    touch frinx.conf
    

Enter the following into the file and save it. Parameters in [] are explained below:

    input {
      log4j {
        mode => server
        port => 9500
        type => "log4j"
      }
    }
    output {
      elasticsearch { hosts => ["localhost:9200"] }
    }
    

For more info see: [Getting started with Logstash][6] and [Log4j][7]

We started elasticsearch and kibana after downloading (see the start of this guide).

We now need to start logstash. Move to your main logstash folder:

    cd ..
    

The start logstash with

    bin/logstash -f config/frinx.conf
    

**Operation**

We have already started elasticsearch, kibana, and logstash. Now start karaf as normal by going to your FRINX ODL Distribution main directory for example distribution-karaf-2.3.0.frinx.

Then type

    bin/karaf
    

All logging information is now logged to an Elasticsearch node though Logstash. This information can be analysed with Kibana. Open Kibana in a Web browser by going to <http://localhost:5601>
